    The web page is made up of 2 major components:
    a) the layout page located in the folder /Pages/Shared as a file called _Layout
    b) the content page

    The content page should be places in the /Pages folder
    The content page(s) can be placed in a subfoler(s) under the /Pages folder
    The content page is made up of 2 components in separate files
       a) xxxx.cshtml file - contains the html controls and display c# logic
       b) xxxx.cshtml.cs file - this is the PageModel class file
                                this contains the logic to drive the web page
                                this DOES NOT contain any html controls
                                this DOES contain properties for the model class
                                    to transfer data between your web controls
                                    and the model class properties.
                                this file is some times referred to as "code-behind"
